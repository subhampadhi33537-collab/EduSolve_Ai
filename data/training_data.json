We subtract the number of students who have taken both languages: 103 (Spanish and French) + 23 (Spanish and Russian) + 14 (French and Russian) = 140.\n3. We add back the number of students who have taken all three languages (x), because they were subtracted three times: 2225 - 140 + x = 2085 + x.\n4. We know that 2092 students have taken at least one of these three languages, so we set up the equation: 2085 + x = 2092.\n5. Solving for x, we get x = 7.\n\nTherefore, 7 students have taken courses in all three languages.",
